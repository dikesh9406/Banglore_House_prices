# Real Estate Price Prediction:

I built a website that predicts real estate prices in Bangalore using a dataset from Kaggle. 
First, I cleaned the data, removed any outliers, and tweaked the features to make them more 
useful. Then, I used a linear regression model from Sklearn to make predictions. To make 
sure my model was accurate, I used K-fold cross-validation.
I did all this using Python, with Numpy and Pandas for data manipulation, Sklearn for 
modeling, and Flask for the web server. For the website's look and feel, I used HTML, CSS, 
and JavaScript.
After testing, my model was about 85% accurate in predicting real estate prices. I deployed 
the website on an AWS Amazon server using an EC2 instance, and I used Nginx to handle 
web traffic
